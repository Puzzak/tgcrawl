# Contributing Guide

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easier for everyone.

Using this guidline you will be able to make your contribution even more helpful, and developers will be able to help you or to implement your fixes faster this way.

## Issues

The issues page is the preferred channel for [bug reports](https://github.com/Puzzaks/TGCrawl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug),
[features requests](https://github.com/Puzzaks/TGCrawl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ARequest) and [trasnlations](https://github.com/Puzzaks/TGCrawl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATranslation).

While creating the issue, please select all applicable labels (except administrative ones, like `Approved`, `Declined`, `Feature - not a bug`, any `Priority` or status labels).


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` version of the app or by updating your fork to the latest commits.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your device? What is your Android version? What steps will reproduce the issue?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help
people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the device/OS on which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge
into the project.
